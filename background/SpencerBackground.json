						"You spent much of your youth gambling, and racking up debt with the wrong people. Your father always told you that your habits would come back to bite you, and they did. You were forced to become a debt slave, where you were sold around to various owners. Eventually you ended up in the underground pit fighting scene forced to fight to survive, never given the chance to pay off your debts. But spotting an opportunity you fled, escaping from your slavery. Not knowing who you might be hunted by or how long you could avoid them, you decided to travel back home to spend what time you could with your father."
