				"An attuned creature can take a turn to enter and pilot the Talos Mini Titan®, it also requires a turn to stop piloting and leave the Talos Mini Titan®. While piloting the Talos Mini Titan® your speed becomes 30 feet, your AC is equal to 1 + the AC from any armor incorporated into its frame, and your size is considered medium.",
				"You can alter the Talos Mini Titan® with armor with which you have proficiency. To alter the Talos Mini Titan®, you must incorporate it into its frame over the course of 1 hour, during which you must have immediate access to the Talos Mini Titan® and the armor being incorporated into it. To undo this alteration, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while altering the Talos Mini Titan® in this way.",
				"Other magical items can also be incorporated into the Talos Mini Titan®, to do so requires the same process as the one followed for armor. While those magical items are incorporated their attunement requirements carry over to the Talos Mini Titan®."
